</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>The original plan for the weekend was for a BVCC club trip up to
Yorkshire to sample some of the white water that is on offer up North,
but it wasn’t too be. Not to be put of by the lack of water up north
arrangements were for a few of us to head south instead, and down to
Dartmoor. With the rooms booked in a local Travelodge on the Thursday
night, and rain forecast it was looking like a good shout.</p>

<p>On the Saturday morning every meet in the little chef next door for some
breakfast and Wifi signal so we could check the gauges and hut out a
river. Unfortunately there hadn’t been as much rain as was hoped, and
the gauges were still showing on the low side, but we decided to head to
the middle Tavy which wasn’t far for the Travelodge we were staying at
in Oakhampton and go for a look at least. The section in town looked
like it was running, so we left my car at the bottom and headed upto the
get on.</p>
<p>While all the travel faffing and driving had been going on the heavens
had opened, little did we realize it but these little storms would keep
going all day. With the river levels on the rise we were of, during the
time we were on the water the level went from scrape/low on the
rainchasers website to high.</p>
<p>The middle Tavy is a rewarding run, with its more or less continuous
grade 3 water all the way down, most of which can be inspected from the
boat, giving a good fun run. Most of the group had never run the river
before, and those of us that had, couldn’t remember it, so gave a good
opportunity to practice those river leading skills on some interesting
water.</p>
<p>After running the river, and popping into Tavistock town center to get
some food we went down to have a look at the Upper section of the River
Plym. The section was running at a high level, but we only went for a
look this evening.</p>

<p>After heading back to our accommodation, we spent an hour consulting
which pub to visit for food asking the opinions of many including
google, and some locals only to decide to spend the evening at the pub
over the road.</p>

<p>Again over night there hadn’t been much rain, and by the time we got up
on Sunday morning everything was covered in frost. With little rain
forecast for the rest of the day we consulted the rain gauges, and
settled on heading out and paddling the Lower Section of the Plym.</p>
<p>This lower section of the Plym, was of similar difficulty to the section
of the Tavy we paddled on the Saturday with a grading of 3/4. The run
starts of at it most difficult, with some of the rapids hard to see
down, but then settles down into a nice run. At the level we ran it the
group thought that a bit more water would have been beneficial, with a
few of the rapids felling particularly rocky. All in all it was a good
run, that we completed quickly as it was only a few km long.</p>

<p>After we decided to Pots Weir in Exeter to have a look at the play
feature there, but we bravely decided to head into the pub there, as the
weir was running very high after all the rainfall they have seen down
that was in the last few weeks.</p>                </article>
