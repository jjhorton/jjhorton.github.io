</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>After the lack of paddling while up in scotland the opportunity came for
to spend the weekend up in north wales with <a href="http://www.bromleycanoeclub.co.uk/">Bromley Canoe
Club</a>. Unfortunately yet again it
was looking like there would still be a complete lack of water, but
knowing that at least the River Dee would be running I packed my
Playboat and in the early hours of Saturday Morning headed to the
<a href="http://www.tyddynbychan.co.uk/">bunkhouse</a> they were staying at.</p>
<p><img src="images/DSCF2890.JPG" width="350"><div></p>
<p>The Bunkhouse was one I stay at regularly, so regularly with the
different paddling groups that lydia the owner wanted to check which
name they knew me by "Potter", "Harry" or "James" as well as find out
the details of what had happened to Richard's van while up in scotland.
After much faffing and breakfast we headed to the River Dee, which in
the past I have only paddled in low or very high water, but this time it
was a good level, providing some good play waves and serpents tail
almost managed to back loop me, but I managed to keep my head dry.</p>
<p>With the Trywern not releasing for the weekend and only a bit of rain
for the night, we were expecting to end up back on the Dee again
tomorrow, so I chose not to run town fall instead opting for one of the
many river left lines down under the bridge, to get back to the car a
bit quicker</p>
<p>So came Sunday morning, and it turned out there had been a fairly
large amount of rain over night. It soon became apparent as we were
traveling around that the rivers were high, as we saw groups paddling
though fields alongside the A5! After looking around for a bit we
settled on running the River Conwy, which made me wish I had packed the
River Runner - as the playboat (Dagger Kingpin) was hardly the ideal
boat to be takling this in, especially as we watched the gauge under the
bridge disappear bellow the water line</p>

<p><img src="images/DSCF2937.JPG" width="350"><div></p>
<p>The river turned out to be good fun, the river had become big
and bouncy which was great fun in the playboat, testing my ability to
stay upright all the way along. The stoppers produced some entertaining
moments, which combined with the eddy lines ensuring I saw a lot of the
sky on my way down the river. We had a few swims in the group, which
produced some challenging boat chases especially in my little playboat
searching for eddies behind trees and rocks that are normally on the
bank.</p>
<p><img src="images/DSCF2940.JPG" width="350"><div></p>
<p>All in all it turned out to be a great weekend, maybe next time I'll
think to pack my river runner just incase it rains in wales!</p>                </article>
