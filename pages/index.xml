      <description>So I&amp;rsquo;m an Electronic Engineer, who now spends most of his time doing DSP and Signal processing at work. I spend a lot of time working with MATLAB and Simulink in my day job as a &amp;ldquo;Systems Engineer&amp;rdquo; for a defence company. Outside of work you will find my experimenting with Software Defined Radio (SDR), open source FPGA boards, and 3D Printing.
I studied Electronic Engineering at University of Surrey in Guildford, and graduated in 2013.</description>
