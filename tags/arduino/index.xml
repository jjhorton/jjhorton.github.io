        <description>&lt;img src="https://jjhorton.co.uk/img/QuadcopterFrame.png" alt="Featured image of post Processing Power" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get everything talking together I’m going to need something to sit in
the middle, and provide all the processing power. On the recommendation
of my supervisor I had a look at the arduino boards. The arduino boards
are based on Atmel processors in the middle with a boot loader
per-installed to allow the uploading of programs straight onto the board
from USB.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many variants of the processor available, all with more than
enough programming power for what I will be doing, the important thing
for me to consider was which input and output interfaces I’d need for my
quad rotor. The key one that I decided I’d need where,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Serial&lt;/strong&gt; – to provide my communication link to the computer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I2C&lt;/strong&gt; – this would provide all the communications between my main
board and any sensors that would be required&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4 x &lt;strong&gt;PWM outputs&lt;/strong&gt; – these would be used to control each of the
motors that will be on board the Quad Rotor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After considering all these factors, the next thing to consider is ease
of integration and the size and weight limitations. I made the decision
to purchase an &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardNano&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Arduino Nano
board&lt;/a&gt;, this provides all
the I/O pins that I require in a very small package. This board also has
the voltage regulators that I’ll require for my circuit, reducing the
component count on the main board.&lt;/p&gt;
