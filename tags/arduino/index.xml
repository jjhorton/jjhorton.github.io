      <description>To get everything talking together I’m going to need something to sit in the middle, and provide all the processing power. On the recommendation of my supervisor I had a look at the arduino boards. The arduino boards are based on Atmel processors in the middle with a boot loader per-installed to allow the uploading of programs straight onto the board from USB.
Arduino Nano Board There are many variants of the processor available, all with more than enough programming power for what I will be doing, the important thing for me to consider was which input and output interfaces I’d need for my quad rotor.</description>
