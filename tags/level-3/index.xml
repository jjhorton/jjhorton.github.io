      <description>For the communication system, there are many choices available from the traditional route of model building and control. The main issue with these systems is that they are very expensive, so for my project I have chosen to use a Bluetooth module.
The module that I have chosen is the Spark fun Bluetooth Mate Silver from proto-pic.co.uk, this simply attaches to the RX and TX lines on the arduino processor that I’m using, this makes the communication very simple, helping to reduce the development time.</description>

      <description>Well one day after looking though pictures of these magical 4 rotor helicopter type things hovering, I was sold it was a good idea… that was over a year ago, and now I’m building one for my 3^rd^ year project at university. The quad rotor uses 4 rotors, 2 rotating one way and 2 going the in the opposite direction. The forces can be shown on a simple wire frame model</description>
