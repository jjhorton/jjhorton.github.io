        <description>&lt;img src="https://jjhorton.co.uk/img/QuadcopterFrame.png" alt="Featured image of post Low Cost Quad Rotor Design and Implementation Report" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that the project is long finished and my marks for the year have
been given I thought I would share the final report for the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the project was not completed, with me unable to finish tuning
the PID control loops to a standard were it would be able to fly, I was
successfully able to get the quad rotor to be able to balance most of
the time on its test jig. Hopefully at some point in the future I will
be able to finish the project, but at the moment there is just too much
to do and not enough time.&lt;/p&gt;
