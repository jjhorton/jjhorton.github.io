      <title>RP2040 Mini PMod</title>

      <description>My pervious RP2040 PMod board included 3 PMod Connectors and a USB-C, this has been a great little board for development and testing but there are a couple of issues with this board. The first problem is the size, I would prefer something a bit smaller, with only a single PMod connector. The second is the lack of some additional storage, for logging data to such as GPS positions, and then finally is the cost with the expensive USB-C connector used on my original design being a particular problem, costing more than the RP2040 Micro Controller.</description>

      <description>As part of my PCB design workflow I use kibot to process my PCB&amp;rsquo;s and generate the Gerber files I need for PCB manufacture, but sometimes to make better use of the of the PCB size I want to create panels that are the minimum size I need to pay for with JLCPCB who I frequently use to make these boards. Another problem I have found when doing respins of boards that have problems or errors, is keeping track of different versions, while i have tried in the past to keep up with a version on the board this hasn&amp;rsquo;t always worked out, so for these boards I wanted to add reference to the git version used to generate the files.</description>
