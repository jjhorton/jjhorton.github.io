      <description>Having picked up a couple of LED Matrix&amp;rsquo;s from aliexpress that I thought should finally be put to some good use, having perviously made up some IR Thermal camera PMods I thought it would be a great idea to hook them up together, and have a nice big display with the array from these sensors scaled up.
The hardware that is needed mostly relies on what I had already built, mainly the RP2040 PMod Board and the PMod IR Camera, but there is the need for a board to interface between the HUB75 display and the RP2040 PMod board.</description>
