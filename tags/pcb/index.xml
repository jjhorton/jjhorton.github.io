      <description>Having previously purchased a several FPGA development boards, this is the latest one for working with both Yosys and Next-pnr, an open source FPGA tool chain. I have brought 2 of these other boards which are both based around the color light modules, these boards are avalible as both the Lattice ECP5 FPGA Colorlight i5 Development Board and Lattice ECP5 FPGA Colorlight i9 Development Board. They include a breakout board that allows you to connect PMod Modules, HDMI (Which i&amp;rsquo;ve never used) and a USB-C port that allows the connection of a computer to do the programming and serial connections.</description>

      <description>Having perviously got my Neopixel PCB working with my RP2040 Board, i&amp;rsquo;ve be wanting to spend some time building up a FPGA example, that has some of the same functionality. For this I wanted to build an example in Verilog that could be deployed to my icebreaker FPGA devboard, with its ice40 FPGA which as 5K LUTs is a great match for this task with it serial over USB link and PMod Connectors.</description>

      <title>Designing PCB Filters using MATLAB</title>

      <description>Mathworks released the RF PCB Toolbox with the latest release of MATLAB, R2021B, this toolbox allows the creation and visualisation of &amp;ldquo;Transmission lines, Couplers, Splitters, Filters, and More&amp;rdquo;, this was something that I wanted to a go at particularly the design of the filters. These filters that are just made of PCB traces have always fascinated me and given the tools that should allow me to design them, I decided to give it a go.</description>
