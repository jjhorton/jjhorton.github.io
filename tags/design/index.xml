        <description>&lt;img src="https://jjhorton.co.uk/img/QuadcopterFrame.png" alt="Featured image of post Quad Rotor Project, Introduction" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well one day after looking though pictures of these magical 4 rotor
helicopter type things hovering, I was sold it was a good idea… that was
over a year ago, and now I’m building one for my 3^rd^ year project at
university. The quad rotor uses 4 rotors, 2 rotating one way and 2 going
the in the opposite direction. The forces can be shown on a simple wire
frame model&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For my project as an electronic engineer I am concentrating on the
electronic systems that control the quad rotor rather than the frame and
structure itself, as a result I have purchased a frame, which comes with
the motors and propellers. This leaves me to focus on building the
electronic system, and control software for my quad rotor, the frame was
purchased from uavshop.com.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On my Blog I will post updates of how the project progresses, as I do
each stage of the project.&lt;/p&gt;
