      <title>Infrared Sensor with an LED Matrix</title>

      <description>Having picked up a couple of LED Matrix&amp;rsquo;s from aliexpress that I thought should finally be put to some good use, having perviously made up some IR Thermal camera PMods I thought it would be a great idea to hook them up together, and have a nice big display with the array from these sensors scaled up.
The hardware that is needed mostly relies on what I had already built, mainly the RP2040 PMod Board and the PMod IR Camera, but there is the need for a board to interface between the HUB75 display and the RP2040 PMod board.</description>

      <title>Getting started IKEA Vindriktning in Home Assistant with Pico W</title>

      <description>The IKEA Vindriktning is an air quality sensor sold for just Â£13, that makes use of a PM1006 sensor inside to detect particle matter in the air. Normally the readins from the sensor are displayed on one of 3 LED&amp;rsquo;s on the front of the unit, but here we are looking to collect this data and add it into Home Assistant .
There are a large number of posts and instructions avalible online for modifying the IKEA Vindriktning or removing the PM1006 sensor and building a Home Assistant integrated sensor using an ECP32 module.</description>

      <description>This little project involved building something unnecessarily complex when there are many much cheaper options that would have done the job just fine. The reason for this was that my girlfriend likes the light up gin bottles from Marks and Spencer&amp;rsquo;s, and I though there could be a better way to create my own, and if your going to have a Light up bottle, it is always going to be improved by having programable RGB LED&amp;rsquo;s.</description>

      <description>Christmas Countdown on the Whiteboard Using my 7 segment display I wanted to build a Christmas countdown, this was just going to use the PMod Display that I had around, and then run from one of the RP2040 boards that I built earlier this year. As I wanted a count down that is frequently updating, I chose to use the countdown in seconds, as this for the month of December easily fits within the seven segments available.</description>

      <title>Seven Segment Display PMod Board</title>

      <description>Ive always wanted to build a severn segment display, there is something about the old school style displays that it is hard to beat to display random numerical data like in the movies.
The 7 Segment display that I decided to use, comes with 4 digits per display, and I was looking to combine two per PMod Board, with 8 LED per segment, we don&amp;rsquo;t have enough pins to be able to control them all.</description>

      <title>Infrared Sensors and Neopixel screen</title>

      <description>After perviously building a PMod Infrared Sensor board, that was perviously streaming data ovesr the serial link from the RP2040 PMod board to a PC which was using Python to display the data. The next step is to look at using a screen to display the data from the infrared Sensor.
The screen that I looked to use is a custom board based on using the Neopixel LED&amp;rsquo;s that I have previously used with the RP2040 board, this allows a simple way to display the data, the screen which is also a 8x8 grid the same resolution as the sensor.</description>

      <title>RP2040 PMod PCB</title>

      <description>Having perviously built myself a Pico PMod Board around the Raspberry Pi Pico, I wanted to take this to the next level, and build myself a few boards from scratch. So once the orders went live for the RP2040 microcontroller a few months ago, I ordered some, and then did nothing with them for a while.
Like many people, I seem to end up with more ideas than time and it took me a little while to get around to this one.</description>

      <title>PMod 8x8 Infrared Sensor</title>

      <description>After seeing a post on twitter where someone was experimenting with the AMG8834 sensor, and I wanted to give it a go. This sensor can be purchased preassembled on breakout boards, ready to drop into a breadboard and build a system around.
While I could build something around these breakout boards, I decided to take a different route and have a go at building one of my own boards. for the connector I wanted to use a PMod, as this would allow me to use the board with both my Raspberry Pi Pico Boards that I just made, as well as the iceBreaker FPGA board I already own, and maybe in the future I may have a go with getting it working with my Zynq based Cora Z7 board.</description>

      <description>Pico on a Breadboard After picking up a few Raspberry Pi Pico&amp;rsquo;s, I was looking for a use for them and I decided to hook up a few of the PMod boards I have from playing around with FPGA. This PMod boards all use the same pinout, of 12 pins, which consists of 8 I/O pins, two 3.3V, and two GND connections on a two row 2.54mm header. I have a few kicking around from a more complex ones, down to a simple 8 DIP switch and a 7 segment display.</description>
