      <description>For a couple of months I&amp;rsquo;ve been slowly building up a little project using some Development boards that include an FPGA, typically once i&amp;rsquo;ve finished editing my design I run all my simulations, tests and then check I can still build the firmware. While running these manually before each commit isn&amp;rsquo;t typically much an issue, I wanted to automate this.
The project i&amp;rsquo;m working on uses a ColorLite i5 FPGA board, this with it Lattice ECP5 FPGA allows me to use a set of Open source tools to test and build my FPGA images.</description>
