      <description>The Pluto SDR is available from a number of suppliers, I got this one from mouser, and the stock was recent enough to be one of the current version, which allows access to a great extra feature, a second Receive and Transmit Chain. All that is required is a few modifications that can be done at home to allow physical access and then enable the ports.
The first step for me was adding in the physical place for the SMA connectors that will take the signal out of the case, for this I drilled two holes to drop the panel mount connectors.</description>
