      <description>Last weekend was spent in one of the places that I have kayaked the most, dartmoor. Although trips here normally revole around the river dart, normally on the loop and upper this time we found ourselves looking further afield. Paddling with 4 friends from uni on the same weekend that the River Source event the aim was to try and avoid the country park as best we could.
Our accommodation for the weekend was a YHA camping barn which is basic at best, very different to the usual bunkhouses with beds and central heating.</description>
