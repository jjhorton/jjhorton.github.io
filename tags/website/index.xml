      <description>Every 5 years I seem to upgrade my website, in 2012 I upgraded my old static site to a wordpress site, then 5 years later in 2017 I changed to a static HTML website generated by Pelican. This statically generated website was hosted on github pages, this is a setup I liked, with all my website files stored in git and then deployed automatically with github workflows when I merged a pull request with a new post in it.</description>
