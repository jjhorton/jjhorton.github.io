      <description>Mathworks released the RF PCB Toolbox with the latest release of MATLAB, R2021B, this toolbox allows the creation and visualisation of &amp;ldquo;Transmission lines, Couplers, Splitters, Filters, and More&amp;rdquo;, this was something that I wanted to a go at particularly the design of the filters. These filters that are just made of PCB traces have always fascinated me and given the tools that should allow me to design them, I decided to give it a go.</description>

      <description>This post is going to take a look at some Filters that I have &amp;ldquo;made at home&amp;rdquo;, for when I am experimenting with my Software Defined Radio&amp;rsquo;s. The filters are for use in the 433MHz band, and I wanted to create some bandpass filters to improve the IQ Recordings I was making, as I was getting a lot of out of band interference on my Pluto SDR.
For a 433MHz Filter I could have just purchased some pre-made boards, complete with some simple filters on ebay, there were plenty of options but they all seemed a little expensive, so what harm is there in just having a look at trying to build something myself.</description>
