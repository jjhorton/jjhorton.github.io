      <description>As part of a project that I&amp;rsquo;m completing in my masters course at university I found that I need to plot data on a map, specifically the routes of undersea cables that pass though the oceans and the depth of the sea bed. My group needed this information so that we would be able to prove that the plan we had for the product we were producing had a suitable depth rating as well as being in range of the cables we were going to be fixing.</description>
