      <description>This post is as much a note to myself, for the next time that I hit this issue, which is installing Inspectrum with SigMF support.
The tool I&amp;rsquo;m installing is Inspectrum which is for analysing captured files of sampled data, primarily from Software Defined Radios. This allows for looking at signals, and analysing what is in the capture. I was looking to use this tool with some SigMF files, the Signal Meta data files are made up of a Binary File containing the sample data, and a JSON companion file, which contains details about the capture.</description>
