</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Last weekend was spent in one of the places that I have kayaked the
most, dartmoor. Although trips here normally revole around the river
dart, normally on the loop and upper this time we
found ourselves looking further afield. Paddling with 4 friends from uni
on the same weekend that the <a href="http://gene17.com/riverssource/">River
Source</a> event the aim was to try and
avoid the country park as best we could.</p>
<p><img src="images/DSCF1897.JPG" width="350"><div></p>
<p>Our accommodation for the weekend was a <a href="http://www.yha.org.uk/barn/great-hound-tor-camping-barn">YHA camping
barn</a> which is
basic at best, very different to the usual bunkhouses with beds and
central heating. This was a barn with some areas for sleeping, a gas
camping stove, and a wood burn and that is it. The main advantage of
this was that it was dirt cheap, helping keep the cost fo the weekend
down.</p>
<p>On Saturday morning we were joined by Rich who for reasons we never
really worked out had driven down in the small hours of the morning, and
we paddled the Walkham. The river Walkham both me and Richard had
paddled before, but for the others this was a new river. The levels
were reasonably good, although in places we could have done with a few
more cm's. One surprise that we did find was a log stuck just bellow the
slot, which was a point of concern, but didn't cause us any issues.</p>

<p>We had originally hoped we would be able to do 2 rivers on the saturday
morning, and although we were up bright and early it didn't work out,
allowing us only 3 hours until sunset as we reached our get off we
headed for a local cafe for some warmth, before heading on to the pub in
Princetown.</p>

<p>Sunday morning didn't really go to plan, after going to sleep a bit
later than planned as we were sat around the warm fire, followed by the
phone we were using as a alarm running out of battery we didn't even
wake up until 8:30. The group headed of to see if the River Erme had
enough water to run, and although it was on the low side decided it
would be runnable. Richard and myself had been lucky enough to have
paddled it in the summer when it was higher and decided to give it a
miss with Richard joining some of my mates from <a href="http://www.bromleycanoeclub.co.uk/index.php">Bromley Canoe
Club</a> who had been down for
the <a href="http://gene17.com/riverssource/">River Source Weekend</a> that was
taking place at the country park.</p>
<p>I decided to head to a local cafe, and then take a walk up the path to
get a few photos of the group heading down the river. We then hit the
road home with a short diversion into Exeter to <a href="http://www.millontheexe.co.uk/">Mill on the
Exe</a> to see the Pots Weir and have a
meal before heading back to guildford.</p>
